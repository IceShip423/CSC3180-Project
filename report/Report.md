**Please kindly note that our group originally had 4 members, but one member withdrew from this course on around April 10^th^ and didn’t tell us until April 20^th^. As it was too late, we failed to invite other classmates to join our group. As a result, our group only has 3 members. This is an unpredictable force to our group. We hope you can add this into concern when you evaluate our project.**



## Background and Motivation

Unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) is a powerful platform that has the ability to autonomously cruise and complete assigned tasks. People only give commands to UAVs and do not control the way that they work in. All tasks are completed all by UAV.  Recently UAVs have been applied to many industries like transportation and the military. In transportation, UAV can decrease the cost significantly. In the military, UAVs are cheap compared to missiles and have a large threat to the enemy. Therefore to complete different kinds of tasks, UAVs need lots of different systems. The basic systems of UAV contain Multi-UAV supervision and control system, attitude control system, obstacle avoidance system, route planning system, and so on.

We choose AI-driven UAV swarm as our topic because (…).

## Project Overview

We hope our UAV swarm has the following functions:

1. Cruise as a group while avoiding obstacles respectively
2. Plan route to accomplish reconnaissance tasks

We accomplished these two functions separately, and combined them in our final demonstration.
